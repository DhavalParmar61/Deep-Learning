Image Classification

I have Implemented two approaches for image classification on Fashion-MNIST data set and compared the results.
1. Multilayer Neural Network 
2. Convolutional Neural Network

I am getting classification accuracy of 89.01% for multi layer neural network and  92.84% for convolutional neural network.
Results clearly states that Convolutional Neural Networks are better able to capture features of image data.
More detailas can be found in report.
